# Graph theory in C and Python

This library written in C and a bit of Python provide the most important aspect of working with graphs, providing multiple algorithms ranging from Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to Dinic's algorithm for Maximun Flow.

My aim is to constantly add and improve this library, while collaberating with other amazing people.
